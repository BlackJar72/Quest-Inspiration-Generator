# Quest Inspiration Generator

This is a simple app that rolls on some random tables containing a mix of 
both archetypes and tropes to act as inspiration for RPG adventures.

The idea is to generate a bunch of somewhat vague plot ideas that can 
be interpretted loosely and the relationships thought through as a source 
of initial inspiration.  Of course, not everyting needs to be used, and 
whether or not any two entries are separate or different aspects of the 
same part of the story is up to you -- and none of it needs to be taken 
litterally, unless you want to of course.  Not all results will be easily 
made into anything coherent, but you can always just generate a new one. 
I find the best results are those that are not all completely obvious in 
how they are related but not bizarre in combination.  In the end, it is 
only intended to server as inspiration for a starting point that should 
developed, modified, and fleshed out.

Printing was planned, but since I could get the new Qt creator create a 
project and the latest NetBeans requires I change my default Java version 
(to one that would break the old Minecraft version I prefer), it was instead 
made in with C# with Unity -- and sadly Unity doesn't support printer access 
(I guess not many games require that, and making extern tools and non-game 
apps was not a priority).  Saving text files may or may not be added later.

(I have no idea what kind of results into AI, as I prefer to make up my 
own content ideas -- its just good not to have to start from a vacume or 
wait for some other source of inspiration.)
